This document provides a User Reference Guide for CANARY-EDS 5.0

To learn about the differences between the version 4.3 and 5.0 configuration
file formats, please see the chapter \ref userConvert. A configuration-file 
generator is available on the
CANARY-EDS website. This utility can create version 4.3 compatible or version 5
native format configuration files from a text file containing water quality data.
This utility is discussed in more detail in \ref userBuildConfig.

The new configuration file is discussed in the chapter \ref userConfigfile. Each 
CANARY-EDS component's configuration is discussed in its own section of the
chapter \ref userConfigDetails.

This Reference Guide covers how to configure and run CANARY-EDS. For information
on how to extend and develop for %CANARY, please see the 
<a href="../html-dev/index.html">Developer Guide</a>.

Additional resources include:

\li The original User's Manual for CANARY version 4.3.2 \cite epa2012 is still
    current, with CANARY-EDS 5.0 being backward compatible and able to read
    version 4.3 configuration files.

\li The CANARY Quick-Start Guide \cite quickStart provides information on how
    to get CANARY-EDS 4.3 up and running. A similar guide is in progress for 
    the new CANARY-EDS 5.0.

\li The CANARY-EDS tutorials are available online

\li Project web pages are maintained at http://software.sandia.gov/trac/canary
    including links to frequently asked questions, documentation, publications,
	mailing lists, and other resources.
